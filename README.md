# Movie Recommendation System - Customer Analytics
In this project, we tackle the challenge of movie recommendation, employing various collaborative filtering techniques to predict and suggest three films tailored to the preferences of our group members. These predictions are based on rating data gathered from our classmates. We also address the challenge of recommending new movies that lack historical rating data. To accomplish this, we enrich our model by incorporating additional variables such as movie genre, release year, and running time, as well as demographic data like gender from our classmates. Lastly, we extend our framework to offer non-personalized movie suggestions for three new customers. We validate the effectiveness of our recommendations by comparing them to additional rating information obtained from these new users.
